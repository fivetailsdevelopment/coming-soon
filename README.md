# iCodeThis - Coming Soon

## The challenge

The challenge was to create a faximile of the Coming Soon screenshot (see file in repository main folder).

## The solution

-This solution has taken some liberties with the design:

    -- due to the card layout (and time constraints for making a lot of cards), a max screen size has been designed, after which the content is contained within a fixed-size window.

    -- Some of the content in the screenshot was illegible or cut off, so attempts have been made to reporduce or used placeholder text as a replacement.

    -- Ownership of the profile photos was unclear so new photos were sourced from sources such as Freepik.

    -- Any official logos remain the property of the company that owns them and have only been used here to reproduce the challenge posed on iCodeThis.

## Future considerations

Due to the repeated building of cards that had different layouts, font sizes, etc, there was a lot of code "duplication". Under normal circumstances, the card section may be better designed as an image in instances such as this where (it is assumed) the cards are just used for showcasing and not meant to be operable.
